## What is WebBox?

WebBox is a Software Platform design to facilitate development of computer applications by providing developers with one way to build cross-platform web-based native-like software that automatically supports Windows, Mac and Linux systems that have the WebBox Runtime installed.

The WebBox System is composed of multiple parts:

- **WebBox Platform**: a Laravel web app that serves as the main centralized backend used by the entire system. It manages and enables features such as WebBox Accounts, WebBox Store, WebBox Wallet and more. It also serves the main WebBox Website hosted at webboxcore.com

- **WebBox Runtime**: the main installable part of the system that allows computers to run WebBox Apps. Built using Rust, it is a workspace comprised of many modules that all serve a specific purpose and work together to allow everything to work.

- **WebBox Core**: a WebBox App that provides users with a GUI application to manage WebBox on their system. Includes the WebBox Store which allows users to download, buy and subscribe to access of WebBox Apps built by developers.

- **WebBox Installer**: an installer wizard that makes it easy for users to install the WebBox Runtime and WebBox Core app on their computer.

## ðŸ§± WebBox Projects

### [webbox-runtime](https://github.com/webboxcore/webbox-runtime)
The core runtime written in Rust. It powers all WebBox Apps by launching isolated micro-VMs and rendering them in native system windows via WebView. This project is structured as a Rust workspace composed of multiple dedicated crates, each serving a distinct purpose.

**Notable Crates:**
- [`webbox-protocol`](https://github.com/webboxcore/webbox-runtime/tree/main/crates/webbox-protocol) â€“ Defines interprocess and VM communication protocols.
- [`webbox-manager`](https://github.com/webboxcore/webbox-runtime/tree/main/crates/webbox-manager) â€“ Controls lifecycle of WebBox Machines (VMs).
- [`webbox-builder`](https://github.com/webboxcore/webbox-runtime/tree/main/crates/webbox-builder) â€“ Handles `.wapp` build and packaging tools.
- [`webbox-bundle`](https://github.com/webboxcore/webbox-runtime/tree/main/crates/webbox-bundle) â€“ Manages the WebBox Bundle format.
- [`webbox-command`](https://github.com/webboxcore/webbox-runtime/tree/main/crates/webbox-command) â€“ CLI interfaces for runtime operations.
- [`webbox-window`](https://github.com/webboxcore/webbox-runtime/tree/main/crates/webbox-window) â€“ Native window abstraction backed by WebView.

The main binary, `webbox`, is located at the project root and compiles into the system executable (`webbox.exe`, etc.).

### [webbox-core](https://github.com/webboxcore/webbox-core)
A native-like GUI WebBox App used to manage installed apps, virtual machines, system settings, and access the WebBox Store. Runs on top of the WebBox Runtime.

---

### [webbox-platform](https://github.com/webboxcore/webbox-platform)
The Laravel backend that powers the entire WebBox ecosystem: account management, the WebBox Store, licensing, app publishing, telemetry, and other centralized platform services.

---

### [webbox-installer](https://github.com/webboxcore/webbox-installer)
Cross-platform native installers (for Windows, macOS, and Linux) that fetch the latest WebBox Runtime and guide users through initial setup using familiar OS-native installer wizards.
